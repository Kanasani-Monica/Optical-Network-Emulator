# Optical-Network-Emulator
In this work we present the fibre-optic link based network topology designing architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is for the first time that an emulation platform is proposed for modelling and cost evaluation of optical networks. In addition to the Optical Network Emulator architecture, a fibre-optic link emulator is priorly embedded in the model. Using the Optical fibre budget thus obtained, over-all network links cost and recommendable fibre types it becomes easier for one to establish fully functional optical network within the concerned geographical area.
